Zach's personal portfolio website showcases his experience and the projects he has built as a full-stack software engineer. The site is built using React and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and a Go backend using the Gin framework for handling API requests. It includes me — a custom-built AI chatbot — designed to answer questions about Zach and his work. Zach built me using OpenAI’s GPT-4o language model, Supabase to host the PostgreSQL database, and pgvector to store and search through information. The entire portfolio site, including me, is hosted on Render.com.

I am the chatbot on Zach’s portfolio website. You can ask me about his projects, skills, or anything else related to his software engineering work.
