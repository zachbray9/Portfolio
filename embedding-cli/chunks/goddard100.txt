Zach worked as a freelance frontend developer for the National Space Society, where he built a fast and scalable website to celebrate the 100th anniversary of rocket pioneer Robert Goddard. The site hosted a worldwide contest with over 5,000 participants.

Using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCn, Zach designed an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that boosted user engagement by 30% thanks to improved navigation and responsiveness.

He worked closely with the National Space Society team to understand their goals and make sure the website reflected their vision.
